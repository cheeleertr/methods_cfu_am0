# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I'm proud of how much I've learned about the different ways that an object can be manipulated with built-in methods. Many ways to check and change a variable 
are already prepackaged for convenience.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
The power of using methods in our applications is that it allows shorter forms of changing or checking variables so we can write cleaner code quicker.
